      <p> Since I was a kid, I started to watch Pok√©mon. I can't even remember when I started, but it feels like it's been forever. </p>

      <p>After watching it for a long time, I started to play the games.</p>

      <p>In the following order and consoles:</p>

      <li>Pok√©mon Red</li>
      <li>Pok√©mon Blue</li>
      <li>Pok√©mon Yellow</li>

     <img src="./images/gameBoyColor.jpg" alt="">
     <li>Pok√©mon Crystal</li>

     <img src="./images/gameBoyAdvance.jpg" alt="">
     
      <li>Pok√©mon Fire Red</li>
      <li>Pok√©mon Ruby</li>
      <li>Pok√©mon Emerald</li>

      <p>Then... I stopped playing... </p>

      I couldn't play any of the games on Nintendo DSüò™üò´üòîüòì

      <p> And after 8 years, I bought my Nintendo 3DS and tackled the game again, but now, I have discovered the love of competitive Pok√©mon.</p>

         I started to play online tournaments, and I was getting good at it. 
      
         Then 4 games were released: Pok√©mon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon.
      </p>

      <p>
         
         These games were the first ones in a long time which had access to the complete Pok√©dex. Then an additional goal was added to my list: completing the Pok√©dex. I started to trade, train, breed, and collect all the Pok√©mon so I could complete the Pok√©dex. After a lot of hard work, I was able to accomplish it.

        And lastly, I have been playing Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet, in which I was able to go into actual tournaments. Here are some of the photos of these events:
